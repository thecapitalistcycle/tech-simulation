# XML Editors

## Comparison

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_XML_editors

## oXygen

oXygen widely recommended for DITA and everything else. Used by most DITA software.

Proprietary but reasonable academic price USD $100.

Will adopt oXygen. Details in separate notes.

Only has 30 day free trial period so first start with others that help with familiarization and training and could also be relevant.

## Adobe Framemaker

Was industry standard but now overtaken. Windows only. May need to use it later with indexing to suit a publisher workflow. But no need to familiarize now.

No recent books easily available, but may have some tutorial videos and other info worth looking at for overview.

## XMLmind

Also used for DITA software with own open source DITAC rendering toolkit.

Extensive documentation here, also online and probably in the free software download:

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/documentation.html

Claims DITAC has some technical advantages (so might need to consider DITAC later even with oXygen editor instead of XLmind):

DITAC technical docs here:

http://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/documentation.html

Windows only. Supports all comparison features except diff/merge (which should not matter).

More expensive USD $350, Less widely recommended for DITA than oXygen so probably won't adopt.

But does fully support DITA including Lightweight DITA on Windows, with extensive documentation and tutorials:

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/which_editor.html

Does have free personal edition with unlimited free trial (with rendered pdf files made useless except for evaluation).

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/which_license.html

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/license_xxe_perso.html

So do download now for evaluation and familiarization with concepts (don't learn details):

Alternatively, for narrower focus on DITA:

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml#download_xde_perso

Worth starting with this now to familiarize with DITA concepts as there will be a delay for setting up with oXygen.

I assume above downloads include their DITAC. Otherwise it may need to be downloaded separately:

http://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/download.shtml

Extensive general XML Editor tutorials,with videos:

http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/tutorial.html

(Note DITA towards end of list).

More specific tutorials "for the impatient", including specifically for DITA:

## Atom

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)

Widely used editor with Github integration. Thousands of plugin packages. 

Likely to be used by authors with (Github Flavoured) Markdown and extended MDITA for Lightweight DITA.


## Notepad++

Widely used free (GPL) developer's code editor. Windows only. Has XML plug-in.
