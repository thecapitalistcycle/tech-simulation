Also works with SDXchange:

Says imports Vensim .mdl files, XMILE and SMILE but docs do not mention SMILE.

Venpy can also run Vensim directly from python:

## XMILE and SMILE

Link broken from human readable text defined by SMILEv4.pdf 

Replaced with print to pdf here at [SMILEv4.doc.pdf](SMILEv4.doc.pdf) from SMILEv4.doc at:

But an xsd and some other docs are available:

pysd supposedly works with both and with .mdl files from Vensim.

## Vensim

Most popular proprietary and probably strongest. Free downloads by email registration for limited evaluation and for education and public projects so worth investigating.
