Interactive Simulation Models and Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games

We are essentially doing research on the chaotic evolution of recursively self-organizing complex systems such as Life, The Universe and Everything - aka materialist dialectics.

Warning: I reached that conclusion more than two decades ago and still do not know what I am talking about.

I have no expectation of learning enough about the topics below in this decade. My hope, which may be unrealistic, is to have learned enough to find others to work with before the end of the next decade.

**"...The answers we have found have only served to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways we feel that we are as confused as ever, but we think we are confused on a higher level and about more important things...."**

The pioneer for our research did not have the tools available today:

"The value-form, whose fully developed shape is the money-form, is very elementary and simple. Nevertheless, the human mind has for more than 2,000 years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it all, whilst on the other hand, to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms, there has been at least an approximation. Why? Because the body, as an organic whole, is more easy of study than are the cells of that body. In the analysis of economic forms, moreover, neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use. The force of abstraction must replace both. But in bourgeois society, the commodity-form of the product of labour — or value-form of the commodity — is the economic cell-form. To the superficial observer, the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minutiae. It does in fact deal with minutiae, but they are of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic anatomy."

Understanding the work already done requires developing it further. While microscopes and chemical reagents remain of no use, the force of abstraction can now be powerfully assisted by tools for interactive visualization and simulation.

A concluding chapter on "The Capitalist Cycle" was written by Pavel Maksakovsky nearly a century ago and translated more than a decade ago.

Books are not enough, but the revolution will not be televised. Deeper understanding and development requires a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG).

Implementation of that is expected to require the technologies listed below.

## Modeling and Simulation Tools

Studying the chaotically evolving control system for the cyclical growth and development of a chaotically evolving social system involves combining technology from Computational Biology and Systems Engineering as well as Agent Based Computational Economics, Stock Flow Consistent Accounting System Dynamics and Business Processes. Will eventually involve MMORPGs for simulating crises and transition.

Some tools include:

### Eclipse

Provides an Integrated Development Environment that hosts many essential open source and commercial tools.
Will also be needed for other aspects such as DITA XML related to [tech-indexing](https://github.com/thecapitalistcycle/tech-indexing)

https://projects.eclipse.org

I am assuming that Eclipse will be needed anyway for DITA with oXygen XML Editor plugin to Eclipse with XQDT adaptor for Xquery 3+ connecting to BaseX XML database.

https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex/issues/1656

This will require JDK and following from:

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

Installer 2018-12 R

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-12/r/eclipse-ide-javascript-and-web-developers

This includes mylyn:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylyn

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/mylyn

Mainly for task focused interface:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-focused_interface

https://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/FAQ#Task-Focused_UI

and ALM:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management

Mylyn includes task focussed highlighting within model diagrams:

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/mylyn.context.mft

Also includes documentation features:

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/mylyn.docs

Which handles various markups including mediawiki and various outputs including DITA:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language

Also including diagrams:

https://fsteeg.wordpress.com/2010/02/07/diagrams-in-wiki-markup-with-mylyn-wikitext-dot-and-zest/

(Above obsolete - find current for plsntuml, See also Xtext)

Will need:

https://idyll-lang.org

The EMF may or may not be needed for DITA with BaseX and oXygen:

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-12/r/eclipse-modeling-tools

Anywau the EMF and additional packages below will certainly be needed for more technical model development.

Items below are for more sophisticated interactive modeling and simulation

### Open Modelica

was integrated with Eclipse EMF a decade ago:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241204618_OpenModelica_Development_Environment_with_Eclipse_Integration_for_Browsing_Modeling_and_Debugging

works with SD:

https://openmodelica.org/images/M_images/Moses206/moses2016-03-RodrigoCastro-Overview-of-the-Modelica-based-System-Dynamics-Library.pdf

used by Simantics SD:

### Computational Biology

Major overlap with SD and ABM with vastly superior community of standards, tools and ontologies:

http://co.mbine.org/standards

Most of the tools and ontologies are likely to rely heavily on XML and work with Eclipse.

### Papyrus

### Moka

### FMI FMUs for System Dynamics models
