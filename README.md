Interactive Simulation Models and Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games

## Functional Mockup Interface - FMI

We are essentially modeling the developing control system of the cyclical growth and development of an evolving organization of organisms. This involves combining technology from both computational biology and systems engineering as well as economics and business. Will eventually involve MMPORG for simulating crises and transition.

Standard tools include:

### Eclipse

Provides an Integrated Development Environment that hosts many essential open source and commercial tools.
Will also be needed for other aspects such as DITA XML related to [tech-indexing](https://github.com/thecapitalistcycle/tech-indexing)

### Papyrus

### Moka

### FMI FMUs for System Dynamics models
